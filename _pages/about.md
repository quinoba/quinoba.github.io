I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Economics at
[Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). I hold a B.A. in
Economics from
[Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM)](https://www.itam.mx/) and an
M.Sc. in Economics from [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en).

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at ITAM’s
[Center for Economic Research (CIE)](https://cie.itam.mx/) and as a Pre-Doctoral
Research Fellow at Georgetown University through the
[UPPER Global Research Training Initiative](https://upperesearch.org/grti/).

My primary research interest lies in the political economy of development. I am also interested in applied econometrics, particularly as a tool for developing and applying rigorous methods to better understand and try to answer questions in this field.
